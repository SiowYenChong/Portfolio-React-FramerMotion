## How to Use

To work with this project, you can use the following commands:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. It will open your default web browser and show the website at http://localhost:3000. If you make any changes to the code, the page will automatically refresh, and any errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Running this command will launch the test runner in an interactive watch mode. If you want to learn more about running tests, you can find detailed information in the [ testing section.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `npm run build`

When you're ready to prepare your app for production, use this command. It optimizes your app for better performance and bundles React in production mode. The resulting build files will be stored in the 'build' folder. These files are minified, and their names include unique hashes. Your app will be ready for deployment. You can learn more about deployment. You can learn more about deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

### `npm run eject`

Please note that this command is irreversible. Once you eject, you can't undo it. If you find the build tools and configuration choices unsatisfactory, you can choose to eject at any time. When you eject, all the configuration files and dependencies like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc., are copied directly into your project, giving you full control. All other commands except 'eject' will continue to work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can customize them to your liking. You're not obliged to use 'eject,' as the default setup is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments. However, you can take full control whenever you're ready.
